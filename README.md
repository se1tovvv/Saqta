# Saqta drone radio telemetry system & esp32-rf-comms
This project is about creating a real time climate feedback system for Saqta drone project, and  executing radio transmission commands via esp32 and Nrf24l01, showcasing increasing difficulty of data transmission
## Stages

| Folder | What it does | Key concept learned |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| `01-basic-tx-rx` | Sends a fixed message from one board to another | SPI to NRF24, addressing, TX/RX roles |
| `02-sensor-transmission` | Transmits a single sensor reading | Reading a sensor and sending live data |
| `03-climate-telemetry` | Multi-sensor climate station over radio with OLED display | Struct-based packet transmission, `sizeof`, multiple sensors |
| `04-bidirectional` | Two-way comms — receiver acknowledges / requests data | Request–response protocol |

*(Folders 04–05 in progress as the build continues.)*

## Stage 03 — Climate Telemetry 

A wireless climate monitoring system across two independent ESP32 boards for Saqta hexacopter drone project. The transmitter reads a set of environmental sensors, packs the readings into a struct, and sends them over the NRF24L01. The receiver unpacks the struct and shows live values on an OLED — no USB tether, each board runs on its own battery. This stage is significantly different from second, as debug with Serial Monitor and SSD1306 was added to ensure smooth user experience.

### Hardware
- 2× ESP32 (38-pin) — one transmitter, one receiver
- 2× NRF24L01 radio modules
- DHT11 / DHT22 temperature & humidity sensor
- SSD1306 OLED display
- Flame sensor, light sensor (LDR), MQ-2 gas sensor
- Each board runs on its own battery + power switch (fully wireless)

### System overview
- **TX (Transmitter):** reads flame, light, temperature, humidity, and gas → packs into a struct → sends via NRF24L01
- **RX (Receiver):** receives the struct → displays live values on the OLED
